Woody is the same pull-string cowboy sheriff that Andy fell in love with years ago. 
Heâ€™s found a new home with Bonnie and her toys, and heâ€™ll do anything to make sure 
sheâ€™s happy and theyâ€™re all taken care of. But an unexpected reunion with his dear 
friend Bo Peep shows Woody that the world is much bigger than he ever imagined.

Ya know, you've handled this lost toy life better than I could.

You can't teach this old toy new tricks.

Because it's all I have left to do!... I don't have anything else...

Buzz Lightyear is loyal not only to his owner, but to the friends heâ€™s made 
along the wayâ€”especially his once-rival Woody whoâ€™s like a brother to the ace Space Ranger 
these days. Buzz would do anything to support his pull-string buddy, but when his efforts land him in a 
carnival game booth as an inadvertent prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance.
This is an intergalactic emergency.

Do you know these life forms?

My eyeballs could have been sucked from their sockets!

Bo Peep is a long-lost friend of Woody, Buzz and the gang, who always shared a special connection 
with Woody while residing with her sheep on a lamp base at Andyâ€™s house. After being separated for years,
 Bo has become chipped and discarded, but her spirit is far from broken. She has grown into an adventure-seeking 
 free spirit whose strength and sarcasm belie her delicate porcelain exterior.
 Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. Sometimes change can be good!

So, How About You, How's Your New Kid?
