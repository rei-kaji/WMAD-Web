            A <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>  is a fictional energy sword featured throughout the <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span>  franchise. 
            A typical <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> is depicted as a luminescent plasma blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm) in length.
            [1] First introduced in the original <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> film,[a] it has since appeared in most <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> films, with at least one <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> duel occurring in each installment of the "Skywalker saga". 
            The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>'s distinct appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the prequel and sequel trilogies.
        </p>

            As presented in the films, a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>'s energy blade can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little resistance.
            [4] It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be deflected by another blade, by energy shields, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> or by the metal beskar. 
            The blade has even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. 
            Some exotic saber-proof melee weapons have been introduced in the Expanded Universe as well as later episodic films. 
            An active <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. 
            Bringing the blade into contact with another <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>'s blade produces a loud crackle.

            For the original <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> film, the film prop hilts were constructed by John Stears from old Graflex press camera flash battery packs and other pieces of hardware. 
            The full-sized sword props were designed to appear ignited onscreen, by later creating an "in-camera" glowing effect in post-production. 
            The blade is a three-sided rod which was coated with a Scotchlite retroreflector array, the same sort used for highway signs.
            [14] A lamp was positioned to the side of the taking camera and reflected towards the subject through 45-degree angled glass so that the sword would appear to glow from the camera's point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Set decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough Street, in London's West End.
            [15] He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few "greebles" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> prop for Luke before production began. 
            George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. 
            <span class="voice">
                When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... 
                They marched backward through the looking-glass.
            </span> 
            Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where filming on <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> began.
            [16] It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.

            Korean animator Nelson Shin, who was working for DePatieâ€“Freleng Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> in the live-action scenes of a film. 
            After Shin accepted the assignment, the live-action footage was given to him. 
            He drew the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>s with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> blade prop. 
            Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> is made of light, the sword should look "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. 
            He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. 
            Shin also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. 
            The whole process took one week, surprising his company. 
            Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.

            <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>s were present in the earliest drafts as mundane plasma weapons that were used alongside laser guns.
            [21][22] The introduction of the Force in a later revision made the Jedi and the Sith supernaturally skilled; initially they were only portrayed as swordsmen.
            [23] The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> became the Force-user's tool, described in A New Hope by Obi-Wan Kenobi as "not as clumsy or random as a blaster. 
            An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age."
            [24] The source of a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>'s power is a kyber crystal.
            [25] These crystals are also the power source of the Death Star's superlaser.

            Since the release of the first film, replicas of <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>s have been a popular piece of <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> merchandise, ranging from inexpensive plastic toys to the "Force FX" series from Master Replicas, deluxe replicas which use LED-lighted tubes and sound effects to create a close audio-visual representation of what is seen on screen.Disneyland in California sells <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>-themed churros outside its Star Tours attraction.
            [45] Disneyland and Disney World (Hollywood Studios) also sell legacy <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>s which are replicas of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> seen used by the Jedi and Sith in the movies such as Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rey Skywalker, Count Dooku, and Kylo Ren.
            [46][47] Disneyland and Hollywood Studios also offer Savi's Workshop, a place where guests can build their own <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> and choose their own kyber crystal, thereby changing the blade color of their own unique <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>.
            [48][49][50] Besides Savi's Workshop, there is another custom <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> experience. 
            The Star Trader at Disneyland offers guests a chance to build their own <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>, without first paying 200 dollars for the experience.

            With the advent of motion-controlled video games, players were given the opportunity to wield an in-game <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> with their own hands. 
            In the seventh generation of video game consoles, there were several <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> video games available on the Wii (Lego <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span>: The Complete Saga, <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span>: The Force Unleashed, <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span>: The Clone Wars â€“ <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> Duels, <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span>: The Clone Wars â€“ Republic Heroes and Lego <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span> III: The Clone Wars) and one on the Xbox 360 (Kinect <span style="font-weight: bold; border: lightcoral 1px solid; border-radius: 5px;">Star Wars</span>) that utilized motion controls to wield a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span> through arm gestures. 
            Unleashed and Duels, both developed by Krome Studios, have more precise control of the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>, allowing players to swing it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the Wii Remote, while Kinect takes advantage of the eponymous, camera-based motion controller to grant the player a more fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkmagenta;">lightsaber</span>.
