        <p class="art_body">
          Abstract art uses visual language of shape, form, color and line to
          create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence
          from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the
          Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the
          logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of
          visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a
          need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental
          changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The
          sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments
          were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations
          in all areas of Western culture at that time.

        <p class="art_img_body">
          Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and
          non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are similar,
          but perhaps not of identical meaning. Abstraction indicates a
          departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure
          from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete.
          Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for
          verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be Abstract, at
          least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible.
          Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in
          ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially Abstract. Total
          Abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable.
          In geometric Abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find
          references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total
          Abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and
          representational (or realistic) art often contain partial Abstraction.

          Much of the art of earlier cultures signs and marks on pottery,
          textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock used simple,
          geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or
          decorative purpose. It is at this level of visual meaning that
          Abstract art communicates. One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese
          calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.

            Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the
            public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.
            Three art movements which contributed to the development of Abstract
            art were Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic
            independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An
            objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the
            paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and from
            them to the Impressionists who continued the plein air painting of
            the Barbizon school. Early intimations of a new art had been made by
            James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting Nocturne in Black and
            Gold: The falling Rocket, (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual
            sensation than the depiction of objects. Even earlier than that,
            with her 'spirit' drawings, Georgiana Houghton's choice to work with
            Abstract shapes correlate with the unnatural nature of her subject,
            in a time when Abstraction isn't yet a concept .

          In Chinese painting, Abstraction can be traced to the Tang dynasty
          painter Wang Mo , who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink
          painting style. While none of his paintings remain, this style is
          clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings. The Chan buddhist painter
          Liang Kai applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in
          splashed ink" in which accurate representation is sacrificed to
          enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the
          enlightened.A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to Tiantai
          buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually
          inspired many Japanese Zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty
          mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and
          extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by Sesshu
          Toyo in his later years.
