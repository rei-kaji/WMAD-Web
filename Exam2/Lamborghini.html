          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the
            company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand
            touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such
            as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were
            released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura
            sports coupÃ©, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive
            layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but
            sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and
            the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to
            Georges-Henri Rossetti and RenÃ© Leimer and retired in 1974. The
            company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of
            brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans
            purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested
            heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management,
            Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include
            the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road
            vehicle.
            <br /><br />The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation
            in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and
            discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to
            Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power
            Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold
            Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the
            control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines
            were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market
            and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the
            late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent
            economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per
            cent.

          <h2>Lamborghini F1 career</h2>
          <p>
            In contrast to his rival Enzo Ferrari, Ferruccio Lamborghini had
            decided early on that there would be no factory-supported racing of
            Lamborghinis, viewing motorsport as too expensive and too draining
            on company resources. This was unusual for the time, as many sports
            car manufacturers sought to demonstrate speed, reliability, and
            technical superiority through motorsport participation. Enzo Ferrari
            in particular was known for considering his road car business mostly
            a source of funding for his participation in motor racing.
            Ferruccio's policy led to tensions between him and his engineers,
            many of whom were racing enthusiasts; some had previously worked at
            Ferrari. When Dallara, Stanzani, and Wallace began dedicating their
            spare time to the development of the P400 prototype, they designed
            it to be a road car with racing potential, one that could win on the
            track and also be driven on the road by enthusiasts.When Ferruccio
            discovered the project, he allowed them to go ahead, seeing it as a
            potential marketing device for the company, while insisting that it
            would not be raced. The P400 went on to become the Miura. The
            closest the company came to building a true race car under
            Lamborghini's supervision were a few highly modified prototypes,
            including those built by factory test driver Bob Wallace, such as
            the Miura SV-based "Jota" and the Jarama S-based "Bob Wallace
            Special".

            <br /><br />In the mid-1970s, while Lamborghini was under the
            management of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini entered into an
            agreement with BMW to develop, then manufacture 400 cars for BMW in
            order to meet Group 4 homologation requirements. BMW lacked
            experience developing a mid-engined vehicle and believed that
            Lamborghini's experience in that area would make Lamborghini an
            ideal choice of partner. Due to Lamborghini's shaky finances,
            Lamborghini fell behind schedule developing the car's structure and
            running gear. When Lamborghini failed to deliver working prototypes
            on time, BMW took the program in house, finishing development
            without Lamborghini. BMW contracted with Baur to produce the car,
            which BMW named the M1, delivering the first vehicle in October
            1978.

            <br /><br />In 1985, Lamborghini's British importer developed the
            Countach QVX, in conjunction with Spice Engineering, for the 1986
            Group C championship season. One car was built, but lack of
            sponsorship caused it to miss the season. The QVX competed in only
            one race, the non-championship 1986 Southern Suns 500 km race at
            Kyalami in South Africa, driven by Tiff Needell. Despite the car
            finishing better than it started, sponsorship could once again not
            be found and the programme was cancelled.

          <h2>Brand identity</h2>
          <p>
            After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini
            once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo
            was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car
            for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be
            produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.

            <br /><br />The automaker would continue to draw upon the
            bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for
            the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947.
            Espada is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the
            bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double
            meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic
            bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about
            confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track.

            <br /><br />After christening the Urraco after a bull breed, in
            1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the Countach not for
            a bull, but for contacc (pronounced , a Piedmontese expletive.Legend
            has it that stylist Nuccio Bertone uttered the word in surprise when
            he first saw the Countach prototype, "Project 112". The LM002 (LM
            for Lamborghini Militaire) sport utility vehicle and the Silhouette
            (named after the popular racing category of the time) were other
            exceptions to the tradition.

            <br /><br />The Jalpa of 1982 was named for a bull breed; Diablo,
            for the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for fighting an epic
            battle against El Chicorro in Madrid in 1869; MurciÃ©lago, the
            legendary bull whose life was spared by El Lagartijo for his
            performance in 1879; Gallardo, named for one of the five ancestral
            castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed; and ReventÃ³n, the bull
            that defeated young Mexican torero FÃ©lix Guzm in 1943. The Estoque
            concept of 2008 was named for the estoc, the sword traditionally
            used by matadors during bullfights.

          <h2>Concept vehicles</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout its history, Lamborghini has envisioned and presented a
            variety of concept cars, beginning in 1963 with the very first
            Lamborghini prototype, the 350GTV. Other famous models include
            Bertone's 1967 Marzal, 1974 Bravo, and 1980 Athon, Chrysler's 1987
            Portofino, the Italdesign-styled Cala from 1995, the Zagato-built
            Raptor from 1996.

            <br /><br />A retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, the first
            creation of chief designer Walter de'Silva, was presented in 2006.
            President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann denied that the concept would
            be put into production, saying that the Miura concept was "a
            celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about the future.
            Retro design is not what we are here for. So we do the [new] Miura.

            <br /><br />At the 2008 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the
            Estoque, a four-door sedan concept. Although there had been much
            speculation regarding the Estoque's eventual production, Lamborghini
            management has not made a decision regarding production of what
            might be the first four-door car to roll out of the Sant'Agata
            factory.

            <br /><br />At the 2010 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the
            Sesto Elemento. The concept car is made almost entirely of carbon
            fibre making it extremely light, with a weight of 999 kg (2,202 lb).
            The Sesto Elemento shares the same V10 engine found in the
            Lamborghini Gallardo. Lamborghini hopes to signal a shift in the
            company's direction from making super cars focused on top speed to
            producing more agile, track focused cars with the Sesto Elemento.
            The concept car can reach 0â€“62 mph in 2.5 seconds and can reach a
            top speed of over 180 mph.
