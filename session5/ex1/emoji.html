        <p class="text">Gene is an exuberant emojiðŸ˜ƒ who was born without a filter. Because of this, he is able to take the appearance of multiple different standard emojiðŸ˜€s. In the beginning of the movie, he is shown to be unable to control this, yet later in the movie he has control over his quirk. He is shown right-handed when he tries to write on Spam, the white envelope who thinks about sales to trick others.</p>

        <p class="text">Jailbreak is a brown emojiðŸ‘©ðŸ»â€ðŸŽ¤ with a black beanie and with her light blue code breaker watch. She has blue hair, golden eyes, pink cheeks, purple lipstick and wears a black dress and skinny tights.</p>
        <p class="text">When Jailbreak takes off her beanie, she has straight and long brown hair, and also wears a shiny, golden crown, with a little blue jewel embedded in it.</p>

        </div> 
        <p class="text">Hi-5 is a peach Hi-5 emojiðŸ–ðŸ», who works in the cube. He wears a blue bandage on his index finger. He has blue eyes. He's a clown, and enjoys making jokes, but likes his friends just the same.</p>

        </div> 
        <p class="text">Smiler is the main antagonist in the emojiðŸ™‚ Movie. She is the system supervisor of the company and was voiced by Maya Rudolph. She thinks she is the "original emojiðŸ™‚" even though she could have just decorated the floor like that. She later got braces when she broke out her tooth when Poop arrested her when he tried to save Textopolis and stop her from deleting Gene.</p>

        <p class="text">Talk about a cast of characters! Our team built over 300 unique emojiðŸ˜€, troll, pirate, and virus characters.</p>
        <p class="text">The typical time to rig a unique character is extensive, but our rigging supervisor worked with our development team to devise 'smart' rigging systems. Our AutoRig tool was developed for The emojiðŸ˜€ Movie to create quick procedural rigs on diverse secondary characters, based on factors in the model that the code can analyze. Characters like Pizza, Donut, Bathtub, Christmas Tree, and many others were rigged in a fraction of the time it typically takes.</p>
