      <h2>Ocean</h2>
      <p>
        The Ocean (also the Sea or the world Ocean) is the body of salt water
        that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97%
        of Earth's water. An Ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies of
        water into which the world Ocean is conventionally divided. Separate
        names are used to identify five different areas of the Ocean: Pacific
        (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the
        smallest). Sea water covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000
        sq mi) of the planet. The Ocean is the principal component of Earth's
        hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge
        heat reservoir, the Ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the
        carbon cycle, and the water cycle.<br />
        Oceanographers divide the Ocean into different vertical and horizontal
        zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone
        consists of the water column from surface to Ocean floor throughout the
        open Ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones
        depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone
        includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light
        (about 200 m in the open Ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This
        makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and
        microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter
        using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean photosynthesis
        creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone
        is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the Ocean
        ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the
        remaining Ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the
        Ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred
        meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental
        shelf.

        <h2>Ocean and Sea</h2>
        <p>
          The terms "the Ocean" or "the Sea " used without specification refer
          to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the
          Earth's surface. It includes the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern
          and Arctic Oceans. As a general term, "the Ocean" and "the Sea " are
          often interchangeable, although speakers of British English refer to
          "the Sea " in all cases, even when the body of water is one of the
          Oceans.<br />
          Strictly speaking, a "Sea " is a body of water (generally a division
          of the world Ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. The word "Sea "
          can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of Sea water,
          such as the North Sea or the Red Sea . There is no sharp distinction
          between Sea s and Oceans, though generally Sea s are smaller, and are
          often partly (as marginal Sea s) or wholly (as inland Sea s) bordered
          by land.

      <h2>World Ocean</h2>
      <p>
        The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early 20th
        century by the Russian Oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to the
        continuous Ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth. The global,
        interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the world
        Ocean or global Ocean. The concept of a continuous body of water with
        relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance
        to Oceanography.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word Ocean comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus
          the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology. Oceanus was
          believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine
          personification of an enormous river encircling the world. The concept
          of has an Indo-European connection. Greek has been compared to the
          Vedic predicated of the dragon who captured the cows/rivers. Related
          to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some
          early Greek vases.
