        <h2>Watch</h2>
        <p>
          A Watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a
          person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the
          motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to
          be worn around the wrist, attached by a Watch strap or other type of
          bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind of
          bracelet. A pocket Watch is designed for a person to carry in a
          pocket, often attached to a chain. Watches were developed in the 17th
          century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the
          14th century. During most of its history the Watch was a mechanical
          device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and
          keeping Time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called
          mechanical watches. In the 1960s the electronic quartz Watch was
          invented, which was powered by a battery and kept Time with a
          vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz Watch had taken over
          most of the market from the mechanical watch. Historically, this is
          called the quartz revolution (also known as quartz crisis in
          Switzerland). Developments the 2010s include smartwatches, which are
          elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a
          wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are
          only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, which first
          appeared in 15th-century Europe. Watches were not widely worn in
          pockets until the 17th century. One account suggests that the word
          "watch" came from the Old English word woecce - which meant "watchman"
          because town watchmen used the technology to keep track of their
          shifts at work. Another says that the term came from 17th-century
          sailors, who used the new mechanisms to Time the length of their
          shipboard watches (duty shifts).

        Electronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some
        mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also
        require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a
        replaceable battery. The first use of electrical power in watches was as
        a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The
        first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was
        released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster,
        Pennsylvania.

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          A rise in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance
          spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the Time
          and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens. This
          innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from
          perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,[18]
          resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face from around
          1680 in Britain and around 1700 in France. The increased accuracy of
          the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by other parts of
          the movement, igniting a two-century wave of watchmaking innovation.
          The first thing to be improved was the escapement. The verge
          escapement was replaced in quality watches by the cylinder escapement,
          invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and further developed by George
          Graham in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing such as the
          tooth-cutting machine devised by Robert Hooke allowed some increase in
          the volume of Watch production, although finishing and assembling was
          still done by hand until well into the 19th century.

      <h2>Conversions</h2>
      <p>
        Conversions between atomic Time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are for the
        most part exact. However, GPS Time is a measured value as opposed to a
        computed "paper" scale. As such it may differ from UTC(USNO) by a few
        hundred nanoseconds,which in turn may differ from official UTC by as
        much as 26 nanoseconds. Conversions for UT1 and TT rely on published
        difference tables which as of 2022 are specified to 10 microseconds and
        0.1 nanoseconds respectively.
