          Stray is a 2022 adventure video game developed by BlueTwelve Studio
          and published by Annapurna Interactive. The story follows a stray cat
          who falls into a walled city populated by robots, machines, and mutant
          bacteria, and sets out to return to the surface with the help of a
          drone companion called B-12. The game is presented through a
          third-person perspective. The player traverses by leaping across
          platforms and climbing up obstacles, and can interact with the
          environment to open new paths. Using B-12, they can store items found
          throughout the world,<br />
          and hack into technology to solve puzzles necessary to progress the
          narrative. Throughout the game, the player must evade the antagonistic
          Zurks and Sentinels, both of whom will attempt to kill them. The
          game's development began in 2015, led by BlueTwelve Studio founders
          Colas Koola and Vivien Mermet-Guyenet, who wanted to pursue an
          independent project after working at Ubisoft Montpellier. They
          partnered with Annapurna Interactive to publish the game, known by
          its<br />
          working title HK Project. Stray was influenced aesthetically by
          Kowloon Walled City, which the developers felt could be appropriately
          explored by a cat. The gameplay experience was specifically inspired
          by the developers' cats, Murtaugh and Riggs, and the team studied
          several images and videos of cats for research. They found that
          playing as a cat led to interesting level design opportunities, though
          they also<br />
          encountered challenges in balancing design and gameplay. The team
          decided to populate the world with robot characters, which further
          influenced the development of the narrative and backstory. Stray was
          announced in 2020 and became highly anticipated. Following some
          delays, it was released on 19 July 2022 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation
          5, and Windows. It received generally positive reviews, with
          particular praise directed at its artistic design, cat gameplay,
          narrative, original score, and platforming elements; critics were
          divided on the combat and stealth sequences.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Stray is a third-person adventure game. The player controls a stray
          cat, who traverses by leaping across platforms and climbing up
          obstacles, and they can open new paths by interacting with the
          environment, such as climbing in buckets, overturning paint cans,
          operating a vending machine, and clawing at objects. They must solve
          puzzles to progress the narrative, often involving moving obstacles.
          The game also presents several optional activities for the player,
          such as sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to non-player characters,
          all of which often elicit a response.Some of the game's levels have
          open world elements, allowing the player to roam at their freedom. The
          player is accompanied by a drone companion named B-12, who assists by
          translating the language of other characters, storing items found
          throughout the world, providing light, and hacking into various
          technologies to open paths and solve puzzles.Throughout the game, the
          player finds several of B-12's memories, providing more context for
          the story behind the world;most of these memories are optional, but
          some are unlocked through story progression. The player can also
          collect badges, including several optional throughout the world, which
          are then displayed on the cat's backpack. The game world is populated
          by robots, who often employ the player to locate objects that reveal
          more information and progress the narrative.Some robots provide
          optional tasks, such as Morusque, who will play songs upon being
          provided with music sheets found around the slums.The player can
          interact with most robots in the game world. Stray features two types
          of enemies who can kill the player: Zurks, a large, mutated bacteria
          that can swarm and devour the cat;and Sentinels, security drones who
          will attempt to shoot the player upon spotting them. For a portion of
          the game, the player can use a Defluxor attached to B-12 to destroy
          the Zurks, though it can only be used for a limited time before B-12
          overheats and requires a brief charge. The player can evade Sentinels
          by avoiding their sight lines, indicated by glowing lights.

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <h5>Chapter 1</h5>
        <p>
          While a group of four stray cats trek through the ruins of an
          abandoned facility, one becomes separated from the others after
          jumping on a loose pipe, falling into a chasm, and finding itself
          trapped in an unpopulated underground city. The cat soon finds a lab
          where it helps download an artificial intelligence into the body of a
          small drone, who calls itself B-12. It explains that it previously
          helped a scientist but much of its memory was corrupted and needs time
          to recover. B-12 promises to help the cat return to the surface and
          accompanies it further into the city. As they travel farther, the pair
          discover that, while the city is completely devoid of human life,
          their robotic servants, Companions, remain. In the time of humanity's
          absence, the Companions have grown self-aware and have built their own
          society among the ruins of the city, but they likewise are trapped
          underground. The ruins are also infested with Zurks, mutant creatures
          that have evolved to devour both organic life and robots.
        </p>
        <h5>Chapter 2</h5>
        <p>
          The pair meet Momo, who is a member of the Outsiders, a group of
          Companions dedicated to finding a way to the surface. With the
          Outsiders's help, the cat and B-12 are able to proceed to the Midtown
          sector of the city. There, they locate Clementine, another Outsider
          who plans to steal an atomic battery to power a subway train that
          leads to the surface. The trio are caught and arrested by the
          Sentinels, but the cat is able to help them all escape prison.
          Clementine stays behind to mislead the Sentinels while the cat and
          B-12 escape on the subway, which takes them to the city control
          center. B-12 finally recovers all of its memories. It reveals that it
          was originally a human scientist who attempted to upload their own
          consciousness into a robot body, but the process went awry until the
          cat arrived. B-12 also remembers that the city, Walled City 99, was
          built to shelter humanity from a catastrophe on the surface, but a
          plague eventually wiped out the entire human population. Realising
          that humanity's legacy now lies with the Companions and the cat, B-12
          sacrifices itself to open the blast doors over the city, exposing it
          to sunlight which kills the Zurks and deactivates the Sentinels. With
          the main exit unsealed, the cat leaves the city and reaches the
          surface. As the cat leaves, a screen near the exit flickers and
          activates.

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <h5>Chapter 1</h5>
        <p>
          BlueTwelve Studio founders Colas Koola and Vivien Mermet-Guyenet known
          as Koola and Viv, respectively began working on Stray in 2015 as they
          wanted to pursue an independent project after working at Ubisoft
          Montpellier. They maintained a development blog for the game, then
          known as HK Project. After they shared some footage from the game on
          Twitter, Annapurna Interactive reached out in April 2016 to publish
          the project; Koola and Mermet-Guyenet had only developed some "visual
          scenes" by that time, but had a strong direction for the final
          project.Annapurna, which had not published any games by the time the
          deal was formed, assisted in building the company over the years,
          providing occasional feedback for the game but largely leaving
          creative freedom to the developers.Funding for the studio was
          confirmed in April 2017, and the development team grew to five by the
          end of 2017. From early in development, Koola and Mermet-Guyenet knew
          that they wanted to maintain a small team of developers, as they
          prefer working with direct communication;the small team meant that the
          game's scope reduced over time, with focus directed towards elements
          that the developers considered important. After revealing the game,
          the team wanted to focus on production and only begin marketing when
          development was nearing completion; they found that the reception to
          the reveal added to the pressure of delivering a polished
          experience.The game utilises Unreal Engine 4.

        <h5>Chapter 2</h5>
        <p>
          Stray was heavily influenced aesthetically by Kowloon Walled City;
          Koola and Mermet-Guyenet liked that the city was constructed
          organically, and found it interesting to approach as artists. They
          designed some graphical tests of the environments and buildings,and
          found that the city was the "perfect playground for a cat" due to the
          various paths and views. The development team found that gameplay as a
          cat led to interesting level design opportunities, particularly
          regarding platforming and puzzle elements.They encountered artistic
          and technical challenges in balancing interesting game design with the
          open world environment, as items that are typically decorative in
          other such as pipes and air conditioning are designed as explorable
          paths in Stray. The in-game location Antvillage allowed the team to
          experiment with vertical game design, as well as providing several
          path options for the player. The team decided to avoid standard
          platforming challenges early in development, after watching players
          consistently missing jumps, which they thought "didn't feel cat-like";
          according to producer Swann Martin-Raget, the movements of a cat feel
          smoother, which led the team to create its guided movement system
          while still allowing for freedom of choice.The team found that the
          sounds and vibrations of the DualSense controller added to the
          physicality and interactivity of playing as a cat, and the low camera
          angle leads to deeper observation of the environment than a human
          protagonist.
