        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
          Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short,
          rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It
          is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
          have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
          prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
          and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
          on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
          although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been
          known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out
          and prey on humans. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and
          shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
          persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During
          the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast
          Europe, the Caucasus, Western Asia and northern parts of India, but it
          has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and
          one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on
          the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries
          have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
          untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of
          the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
          humans are the greatest causes for concern. <br /><br />
          One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the
          lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on
          national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have
          been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have
          been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across
          the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions
          were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in
          virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and
          current range.

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>
          The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin
          le≈çnem , which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek . The Hebrew
          word lavi may also be related. The generic name Panthera is traceable
          to the classical Latin word and the ancient Greek word panther'.<br />Felis
          leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who
          described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.The genus name Panthera
          was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th
          centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as
          subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005. They were
          distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.
