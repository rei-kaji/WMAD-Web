        <h2>Woody</h2>

        <img class="character_image" src="./images/woody.webp">

        <p class="description">
            <span class="character_name">Woody</span> is the same pull-string cowboy sheriff that <span class="character_name">Andy</span> fell in love with years ago. 
            He's found a new home with Bonnie and her toys, and he'll do anything to make sure she's happy and they're all taken care of.
            But an unexpected reunion with his dear friend <span class="character_name">Bo Peep</span> shows Woody that the world is much bigger than he ever imagined.
        </p>

        <p class="says">
            "Ya know, you've handled this lost toy life better than I could."
        </p>
        <p class="says">
            "You can't teach this old toy new tricks."
        </p>
        <p class="says">
            "Because it's all I have left to do!... I don't have anything else..."
        </p>

        <h2>Woody</h2>

        <img class="character_image" src="./images/buzz.webp">

        <p class="description">
            <span class="character_name">Buzz Lightyear</span> is loyal not only to his owner, but to the friends he's made 
            along the way especially his once-rival Woody who's like a brother to the ace Space Ranger these days. 
            Buzz would do anything to support his pull-string buddy, but when his efforts land him in a carnival game booth as an inadvertent prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance.
        </p>

        <p class="says">
            "This is an intergalactic emergency."
        </p>
        <p class="says">
            "Do you know these life forms?"
        </p>
        <p class="says">
            "My eyeballs could have been sucked from their sockets!"
        </p>

        <h2>Bo Peep</h2>

        <img class="character_image" src="./images/bopeep.webp">

        <p class="description">
            <span class="character_name">Bo Peep</span> is a long-lost friend of <span class="character_name">Woody</span>, <span class="character_name">Buzz</span> and the gang, who always shared a special connection with Woody while residing with her sheep on a lamp base at <span class="character_name">Andy</span>'s house. 
            After being separated for years,
            Bo has become chipped and discarded, but her spirit is far from broken. She has grown into an adventure-seeking free spirit whose strength and sarcasm belie her delicate porcelain exterior.
        </p>

        <p class="says">
            "Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. Sometimes change can be good!
        </p>
        <p class="says">
            "So, How About You, How's Your New Kid?"
