    <h3>
        Zip2
    </h3>

    <p>
        In <ins>1995</ins>, <span class="Musk">Musk</span>, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from <span class="Musk">Musk</span>'s father.
        [44][23] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.
        [45] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.
        [46] <span class="Musk">Musk</span> says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office; 
        he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. 
    </p>

    <p>
        According to <span class="Musk">Musk</span>, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."
        [45] The <span class="Musk">Musk</span> brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[48] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.
        [49] <span class="Musk">Musk</span>'s attempts to become ceo were thwarted by the board.
        [50] Compaq acquired Zip2 for <span class="doller">$</span>307 million in cash in February <ins>1999</ins>,[51][52] and <span class="Musk">Musk</span> received <span class="doller">$</span>22 million for his 7-percent share.
    </p>

    <h3>
        X.com and PayPal
    </h3>

    <p>
        In <ins>1999</ins>, <span class="Musk">Musk</span> co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.
        [54] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.
        [55] The company's investors regarded <span class="Musk">Musk</span> as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit <b>ceo</b> Bill Harris by the end of the year.[56] The following year, 
        X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.
        [45][56][57] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[58] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within the merged company, <span class="Musk">Musk</span> returned as <b>ceo</b>. <span class="Musk">Musk</span>'s preference for Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.
        [60] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted <span class="Musk">Musk</span> and replaced him with Thiel in September <ins>2000</ins>.
        [61][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
        [63][64] In <ins>2002</ins>, PayPal was acquired by eBay for <span class="doller">$</span>1.5 billion in stock, of which <span class="Musk">Musk</span>â€”the largest shareholder with 11.72% of sharesâ€”received <span class="doller">$</span>175.8 million.
        [65][66] In <ins>2017</ins>, <span class="Musk">Musk</span> purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.
    </p>

    <h3>
        SpaceX
    </h3>

    <p>
        In early <ins>2001</ins>, <span class="Musk">Musk</span> became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.
        [69] In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. 
        He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, <span class="Musk">Musk</span> was seen as a novice[70] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. 
        In February <ins>2002</ins>, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. 
        They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for <span class="doller">$</span>8 million, which <span class="Musk">Musk</span> rejected. 
        He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.
        [70] With <span class="doller">$</span>100 million of his early fortune,[71] <span class="Musk">Musk</span> founded <b>ceo</b> in <ins>May 2002</ins> and became the company's <b>ceo</b> and Chief Engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>ceo</b> attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in <ins>2006</ins>.
        [74] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former <b>ceo</b> consultant[75]) Mike Griffin later that year.
        [76][77] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused <span class="Musk">Musk</span> and his companies to bankrupt,[74] <b>ceo</b> succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in <ins>2008</ins>.
        [78] Later that year, <b>ceo</b> received a <span class="doller">$</span>1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its <ins>2011</ins> retirement.
        [79] In <ins>2012</ins>, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.
        [80] <span class="Musk">Musk</span> credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving the company.
